# web-project-structure
A typical web project consists of several key files organized into folders. The main file is usually index.html, which contains the webpage's structure and content using HTML tags. Alongside it, a styles.css file is used to style the webpage with CSS rules, making it visually appealing. A script.js file adds interactivity by handling user actions and dynamic content updates through JavaScript. Sometimes, configuration or data files like config.yaml or config.xml are included to store settings or structured data. These files are stored in the same folder for easy access and management. Additionally, assets like images or fonts may be stored in subfolders. This organized structure helps developers maintain the project efficiently, ensuring that each component has a clear purpose and location. The simple setup allows for scalable development as the project grows larger with more features.
